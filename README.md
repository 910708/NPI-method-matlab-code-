# NPI-method-matlab-code-
this repository is for the people who interested in NPI method of pde for Klein-Gordon equation
1.the files symbolNPI_complex.m and symbolNPI_real.m are the symbol integration for the complex example and real example, respectively.
2.the results are saved in symbol_inte.mat and symbol_intereal.mat
3.the files newnpi1.m newnpi2.m and newnpi3.m are the first-order, second-order and third-order NPI method for the complex cubic Klein-Gordon equation, respectively.
4.the files npi1real.m npi2real.m and npi3real.m are the first-order, second-order and third-order NPI method for the real quadratic Klein-Gordon equation, respectively.
5.Example: if you want to compute the real quadratic kg with second-order npi method, you just need apply the npi2real.m.(the symbol integration has been computed ahead of time)
6.otherwise, if you have any problem about this program, please let me know.
